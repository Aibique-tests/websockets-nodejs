# Testing Nodejs Libraries

## Socket IO
It is important to point out two points:
- It has a server that integrates with the "http" nodejs server (socket.io)
- A client library which loads on the browser side (socket.io-client)

### Getting Started
To getting started with javascript I recommend the tutorial that [socket.io](https://socket.io/get-started/chat) has.
> Typescript
Dependencies:
```

```

### Homework

Here are some ideas to improve the application:

    - Broadcast a message to connected users when someone connects or disconnects.
    - Add support for nicknames.
    - Don’t send the same message to the user that sent it. Instead, append the message directly as soon as he/she presses enter.
    - Add “{user} is typing” functionality.
    - Show who’s online.
    - Add private messaging.
    - Share your improvements!
